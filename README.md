## 🧠 "Vibe Coding": The Story Behind PromptsCraft

This project is a testament to a new paradigm of software development: **Vibe Coding**. The entire application, from the frontend UI to the backend server, was generated by Google's AI tools. The developer's role was to guide the AI with high-level concepts and "vibes", without writing a single line of code.

The development process involved:

-   **Gemini CLI:** For interactive code generation, modification, and debugging.
-   **Google AI Studio:** For prompt design and experimentation.
-   **Stitch:** Leveraged for rapid UI/UX prototyping and visual design.
-   **NotebookLM:** Generating ideas and synthesizing information from various sources including books and other materials.

PromptsCraft is a living example of how AI can not only be a tool for creativity but also the creator of the tools themselves.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, SQLite
-   **AI Development Tools:** Gemini CLI, Google AI Studio, Stitch, NotebookLM
