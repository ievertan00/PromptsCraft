Excellent. I will now analyze the project's code structure and propose a more scalable and maintainable architecture, acting in the role of a Senior Software Architect.

Based on the file structure and code provided, here is a comprehensive analysis and set of recommendations for architectural improvement.

### High-Level Summary of Current Architecture

The current project structure co-locates the frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Express) code within a single root directory. While this approach is straightforward for initial prototyping, it presents significant challenges for scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration. The primary weakness is the lack of a clear boundary between the client and server codebases, leading to a violation of separation of concerns, particularly within the `services` directory which contains a mix of frontend and backend logic.

The proposed changes aim to establish this clear separation by restructuring the project into a monorepo-like structure with distinct `client` and `server` workspaces. This will enable independent development, testing, and deployment, while laying the foundation for a robust, layered architecture on the backend.

### Architectural Review and Recommendations

### 1. Establish Clear Client-Server Separation

**Issue:** The most significant structural issue is the mixing of client-side and server-side files in the root directory and the `services` folder. Files like `server.ts`, `database.ts`, and `serverAiService.ts` (backend) live alongside `App.tsx`, `vite.config.ts`, and `aiService.ts` (frontend).

**Rationale:** This tight coupling complicates the development lifecycle. The build processes are intertwined, it's difficult to scale one part of the application without affecting the other, and it's confusing for new developers to determine which code runs in which environment.

**Suggested Improvement:** Restructure the project into a clear client/server monorepo structure.

**Proposed New Top-Level Structure:**

```
/PromptsCraft
├── /client/
│   ├── /src/
│   │   ├── /components/
│   │   ├── /constants/
│   │   ├── /contexts/
│   │   ├── /services/  (was api.ts, aiService.ts)
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── /server/
│   ├── /src/
│   │   ├── /api/       (Routes/Controllers)
│   │   ├── /services/  (Business Logic)
│   │   ├── /database/  (Data Access Layer)
│   │   ├── /config/
│   │   └── /utils/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── package.json        (Root package.json to manage both workspaces)
└── .gitignore
```

### 2. Implement a Layered Architecture for the Backend

**Issue:** The backend logic is currently concentrated in `server.ts`, which acts as both the web server and the controller layer, with direct calls to the database. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to test and maintain.

**Rationale:** A layered architecture (also known as N-Tier architecture) separates concerns into distinct layers: API/Presentation, Service/Business Logic, and Data Access. This makes the system more modular, testable, and easier to refactor. For example, you could swap out the database implementation without changing the business logic.

**Suggested Improvement:** Organize the new `server/src/` directory into a layered structure.

**Proposed `server/src/` Structure:**

*   **`server/src/api/` (or `routes/`)**: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It should contain the Express route definitions. Its only job is to parse requests, call the appropriate service method, and return a response.
    *   *Example:* `prompts.routes.ts`, `folders.routes.ts`
*   **`server/src/services/`**: This layer contains the core business logic of the application. It orchestrates data from different sources and performs operations. It should be completely independent of Express.
    *   *Example:* `promptService.ts` would contain logic for creating, refining, and managing prompts. `serverAiService.ts` would be moved here.
*   **`server/src/database/` (or `repositories/`)**: This is the Data Access Layer (DAL). Its sole responsibility is to communicate with the database. It abstracts away the raw SQL queries.
    *   *Example:* `promptRepository.ts` would have functions like `findById`, `create`, `update`. The contents of `database.ts` would be foundational here.
*   **`server/src/config/`**: For environment variables, database connections, and other configuration.
*   **`server/src/index.ts`**: The main entry point that initializes Express and wires up the middleware and routes.

**Justification:** This structure provides clear separation of concerns. You can test your business logic (`services`) without needing a running web server, and you can test your database queries (`repositories`) in isolation. It makes the system much easier to reason about and scale.

### 3. Organize Frontend Components by Feature

**Issue:** The `components/` directory is currently a flat list of components. As the application grows, this will become difficult to navigate.

**Rationale:** Organizing components by feature or domain makes the codebase more intuitive. When working on a specific part of the application (e.g., the prompt editor), all related components are co-located.

**Suggested Improvement:** Group components within the `client/src/components/` directory by the feature they belong to.

**Proposed `client/src/components/` Structure:**

```
/client/src/components/
├── /common/          (For truly shared, generic components like Button, Modal, Icon)
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   └── ConfirmModal.tsx
├── /folders/
│   ├── FolderTree.tsx
│   └── FolderSelectModal.tsx
├── /prompts/
│   ├── PromptEditor.tsx
│   ├── PromptList.tsx
│   └── TagInput.tsx
├── /layout/
│   ├── Sidebar.tsx
│   └── ErrorBoundary.tsx
└── /icons/
    └── ...
```

**Justification:** This structure improves discoverability and modularity. It encourages thinking about the application in terms of self-contained features, which also simplifies code splitting and lazy loading in the future.

### 4. Centralize and Type-Safe API Services on the Frontend

**Issue:** The `services/api.ts` file is a good start, but it mixes all entity types (prompts, folders) into one file. The use of `any` for prompt mapping is also a minor issue.

**Rationale:** As the number of API endpoints grows, a single file becomes unwieldy. Separating API service calls by domain makes them easier to manage. Strong typing prevents bugs.

**Suggested Improvement:** In the new `client/src/services/` directory, create separate files for each API domain.

**Proposed `client/src/services/` Structure:**

*   **`client/src/services/folderApi.ts`**: Contains `getFolders`, `createFolder`, `renameFolder`, etc.
*   **`client/src/services/promptApi.ts`**: Contains `getPrompts`, `savePrompt`, `deletePrompt`, etc.
*   **`client/src/services/aiApi.ts`**: Contains `suggestTags`, `refinePrompt`, etc. (the client-side fetch calls).

**Justification:** This aligns the frontend API structure with the backend API structure, creating a more predictable and maintainable codebase. It also makes it easier to implement more advanced data-fetching strategies with libraries like React Query or SWR, which often work best with this kind of organization.
